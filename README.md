# NLP_Book-Classification/Clustering

Background of this project:
Take different transfromation methods(BOW,TFIDF,DOC2VEC) and algorithms to classfiy and cluster five books-chesterton-brown,austen-emma,edgeworth-parents,milton-paradise,bible-kjv

Data preprocessing:
  Convert all letters into lower case
  Remove punctuations
  Tokenize the documents to remove stopwords (nltk library)
  Lemmatization
  Transform text into vector

Classification:

  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
  Logistic Regression

Clustering:
  K-means
  Hierarchical
  Expectation-Maximization (EM)
